# Logic-Programming

This repo includes my programming assignments for the lesson Logic Programming that I attended at UoA during the 6th semmester of my undergraduate studies(Fall 2022).

Exersise 1: runlen.pl
 
For this exercise we had to implement a predicate that takes a list like: [(a,3), (b,4)..] and turns it into another list = [a,a,a,b,b,b,b].
We had also to implement a second predicate that does the exact opposite.

Exercise 2: codegen.pl

For this exercise we had to solve a problem using a predicate that implements interactive depth search.

Exersice 3: domino.pl

We created a predicate that finds the correct spot for dome squares like (1,5) to be put on a domino table.

Exercise 4: maxclq.pl

Find the greatest clique of a graph using ic library.

Exercise 5: liars.pl

Solve another problem using ic library.
